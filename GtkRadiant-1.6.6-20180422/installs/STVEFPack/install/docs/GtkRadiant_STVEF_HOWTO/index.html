    <b><a name="intro">Introduction</a></b>
    <p>
    The purpose of this document is to highlight the parts of <b>GtkRadiant</b> which have changed
    in the new version 1.2. We also discuss the basics of level editing for 
    <b>Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force</b>. This is not the GtkRadiant manual, or a mapping howto though.
    (those topics are covered in other help documents, and on websites).
  
  <p>
    <b><a name="games">Multiple games support in GtkRadiant</a></b>
    <p>
    GtkRadiant supports level editing for multiple games through a central installation
    and some game specific packages. In the case of <b>Star Trek Voyager : Elite 
    Force</b> for instance,
    the editor installs in <i>C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant</i> and puts the game package
    in <i>C:\Program Files\Raven\Star Trek Voyager Elite Force\Radiant</i> (these are default
    paths on win32, your mileage may vary).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When you execute the editor from the Start Menu, it will look for installed game packages.
    If only one game pack is present, then it will start loading for this game directly,
    otherwise it will prompt you with the <b>general preferences</b> dialog, asking you
    which game you want to edit for.
    </p>

      <br>
      <i>Game selection dialog</i>
    </div>    
    
    <p>
    The files describing which game packs are installed and where are in the 
    <i>C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant\games</i> folder. They are created during setup to
    match your particular settings.
    </p>
    
  <p>
    <b><a name="project">Project Settings for STV:EF</a></b>
    <p>
    Once you have selected <b>Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force</b>, the editor will continue
    loading using STV:EF configuration. If it is the first run, it will create a default
    project configuration for you. You can view and edit your project configuration from
    the <b>Files > Project settings...</b> menu.
    </p>

    <br>
    <i>Project settings dialog in STV:EF mode</i>
    </center>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The only thing you should have to modify in the project settings is the mapping mode
    combo menu. Select the right configuration depending on whether you are doing single 
    player maps or multiplayer maps. For instance this will change how 
    <b>Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force</b> is executed after you compile a map.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A bit more of information about the project files: those are .qe4 files in 
    <i>C:\Program Files\Raven\Star Trek Voyager Elite Force\mainEf\scripts</i>. There is a very
    particular file there, 
    <i>quakev2.qe4</i> which Radiant uses to generate your actual project. You should 
    never modify this file unless you know what you are doing. The project files that 
    Radiant uses for everyday run are the <i>user*.qe4</i> files.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    <b><a name="monitor">Compiling and running your maps</a></b>
    <p>
    Any map (i.e. <i>.map</i> file) needs to be 'compiled' into a <i>.bsp</i> file in order to
    be loaded into the engine. This is done by <b>q3map</b>, a compiling utility. <b>GtkRadiant</b>
    provides two ways of compiling maps. It can be done non-interactively by generating a batch file,
    or you can use the <i>monitored</i> mode. This is configured from the 
    <b>Edit > Preferences...</b> menu, in the <b>BSP monitoring</b> tab.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <center>
    <img src="monitor.png" width="712" height="423">
    <br>
    <i>BSP monitoring preferences</i>
    </center>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When you run a monitored compilation, you can follow the progress of q3map in the editor console.
    If the compilation fails because of errors in your map, you will be able to get a clean error message
    and in some cases, a debug window will popup which will help you locate the problem.
    You can also tell the editor to run the map in the engine when the compilation is done (with
    some 3D board you may have to turn on "activate sleep mode" so that you have enough OpenGL resources
    to run the engine)
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Also note that several sample maps (namely <i>voy1</i>, <i>_brig</i> and <i>
    ctf_kln1</i>)
    are provided in the setup. Those are a great source for learning.</p>
  
  <p>
    <b><a name="bspc">BSPC, prepare the map for single player AI</a></b>
  <p>
    If you are doing a Multi-player map, and you want support&nbsp; for Bots in
  the solo match area of Holomatch, you will need to build an .aas file,
     so that the AI (Bots) know where to run. For instance, if you map is <i>foo.map</i>,
    you will compile <i>foo.bsp</i> with <b>q3map</b>, and with <b>BSPC</b> you will have to produce
    <i>foo.aas</i>. A batch file is provided to help the process
    (BSPC compiling is not integrated into GtkRadiant at the moment) which you can find in
    <i>C:\Program Files\Raven\Star Trek Voyager Elite Force\Radiant\makeaas.bat</i>.
  Or download bspc-gui ( A graphic user interface that acts as a front end for
    BSPC) from <a href="http://www.effiles.com">http://www.effiles.com</a>
    </p>

    <b><a name="ICARUS">ICARUS and advanced AI Scripting</a></b>
    <p>
    An important part of the <b>Star Trek Voyager : Elite Force</b> was the single player scripted sequences. This is too 
    broad a subject to embark upon here, and truly it is beyond the scope of 
    this level editor HOWTO, but included in the <b>GTKRadiant</b> package is 
    the ICARUS manual in .html format. Feel free to read it and to experiment 
    with&nbsp; <b>BehavEd</b>, the level and AI scripting tool, which is also included in 
    this distribution.</p>

  <p>
    <b><a name="help">Troubleshooting</a></b>
    <p>
    If the editor doesn't work correctly, make sure that your installation is not broken,
    i.e. you have installed newer version above an older one, or you are trying to use
    and editor binary with incompatible modules and tools (i.e. that came from other sources).    
    </p>
    <p>
    Carefully examine the console of the editor for any error and warning messages. Some
    important things are happening while the editor is starting, before the console is available,
    this is why it is possible to have Radiant log everything to a radiant.log file (which
    will be in <i>C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant\radiant.log</i>). You can turn logging on
    from the preferences menu.
    </p>
    <p>
    If that fails, see the links page that comes with GtkRadiant setup to find forums and help.
    In the editor, the <b>Help</b> menu provides a number of useful shortcuts.
