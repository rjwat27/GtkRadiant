			<span class="maintitle">Campaign File</span><br>
			The campaign file will allow multiple maps to be played as one session using 
			the Experience (XP) system to reward players for completing objectives and 
			playing as a team member. The campaign files are located in the 'scripts' 
			folder. Here is a sample image of the host game UI screen.
			<p>
				<center><img src="images/campaign.jpg"></center>
			<p>
			The campaign script file contains the following keys:
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">name:</td>
						<td>The name to appear in the UI campaign select box.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">shortname:</td>
						<td>Used to start the campaigns from the console (campaign command).</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">description:</td>
						<td>Used to describe the campaign on the host game UI.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">maps:</td>
						<td>A list of maps in the campaign separated by semicolons.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">mapTC:</td>
						<td>The map offset on the big map image. The current onscreen map window is only 
							650x650 pixels. This allows the map pins to be more central located in the 
							onscreen map window.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">type:</td>
						<td>Only one type supported, 'wolfmp'.</td>
					</tr>
