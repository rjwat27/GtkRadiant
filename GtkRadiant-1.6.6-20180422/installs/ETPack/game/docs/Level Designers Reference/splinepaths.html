			<span class="maintitle">Spline Path System</span><br>
			The new spline path system allows entities to move smoothly between predefined 
			points on a map. The system is based on Bezier splines which are the same 
			system used by patches. Each map is limited to 512 spline entities. The new 
			entities are stored independently by server and client and don't add to the 
			runtime entity count.
			<p>
				The spline path is defined by two new entities called
				<span class="code">info_train_spline_main</span>
				and
				<span class="code">info_train_spline_control</span>
			. All spline paths are calculated on the 'fly' and will visually look smoother 
			the higher the frame rate.
			<p>
			The spline path system cannot stop objects mid flow between spline points. For 
			greater control of an objects movement use more spline points.

							<p>
							When an entity is moved to point A it will face on a line towards point B. As 
							the entity moves forward on the spline path it will face towards point B.</td>

							entities targetname key.
							<p>
							When an entity is moved to point A it will face on a line towards the control 
							point. As the entity moves forward it will adjust its face angle based on 
							control and point B.</td>

							how many control points. The key names must be: control, control2, control3, 
							etc. There is an upper limit of 16 control points, and the more you use, the 
							more CPU it requires, though unless there is excessive use there should not be 
							any noticeable problem.</td>

			A new command has been added to BobToolz to enable plotting of the spline paths
