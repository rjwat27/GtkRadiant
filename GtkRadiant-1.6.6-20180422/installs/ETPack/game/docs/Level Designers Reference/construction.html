			<span class="maintitle">Construction System</span><br>
			The design goal for the construction system was to introduce basic RTS style 
			game-play to the multiplayer Wolfenstein universe. The construction system was 
			designed to be as flexible as possible by having support for multiple stages 
			which can be created from either game models or brushwork.
			<p>
			The ability to build constructions is an enhanced feature of the engineer 
			class. Engineers are able to construct objects within maps such as bridges, 
			guard towers and gun emplacements in predefined locations. The construction 
			locations should be marked by the crates model so that everyone can recognise a 
			construction point in the map.
			<p>
			Each construction will have a construction class which defines how much 'charge 
			bar' time is required to complete each stage of the construction. The speed at 
			which an item can be constructed can be increased with additional Engineers.
			<p>
			While the construction is being built a translucent representation of the 
			object will appear and then become solid when built. If a player is in the 
			construction area while being built they will be warned to leave the area 
			before the construction is finished. Players failing to leave the construction 
			zone will be killed the instant the construction is complete.
			<p>
			A construction object which has not finished or been touched by an engineer 
			will decay after 30 seconds (current default) to its previous deconstructed 
			'crates' state. Multiple stage constructions will decay back to their previous 
			built stage.
			<p>
			Once the construction has been built by one team, only the opposing team can 
			damage it. The construction class of the construction object dictates how it 
			can be destroyed. Friendly fire will not apply to constructed objects.
			<p>
				<a class="maintitle" name="conclasses">Construction Classes</a><br>
			Most of the construction system's functionality is located in the scripting 
			system and only the basic parameters are present in the maps. This could 
			present a problem for Level Designers who have had very little experience of 
			scripting but the existing maps do offer a lot of workable examples to study if 
			you're unsure.
			<p>
			The construction system has 6 variables which can affect the way a 
			constructible object will work in-game. These variables are also organized into 
			3 presets so that construction objects can be consistent across all maps. The 
			main difference between each of the construction presets is the 'charge bar' 
			times and the type of explosives that can damage the object.
			<p>
			The largest construction objects in the game were given the highest 'charge 
			bar' value so that it would encourage the engineers to work together on 
			completing objectives. The preset value of a construction should reflect its 
			importance to the overall map objectives. The only exception to the rule is the 
			escorted tanks which have a high health value and can be damaged by all 
			explosives.
			<p>
			All constructible items must have the construction class (preset) defined upon 
			spawning in the map. Further construction parameters can be changed after the 
			construction class has been defined. The following table highlights the presets 
			and what values they use.
			<p>

				All constructible objectives have a core set of entities which are used 
				everytime regardless of construction configuration. Each construction objective 
				must contain at least one
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				and one
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
			entity both linked together.
			<p>
				Neutral team construction objectives contain two
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entities because both teams cannot own the same construction entity. The
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity targets both
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entities.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">func_constructible</span><br>
				The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				is the primary entity which specifies which team can build or destroy the 
				construction. The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				is a <a href="glossary.html#brushentity">brushwork entity</a> and <b>must</b>
			contain an origin brush; otherwise it will cause problems with the planting of 
			dynamite.
			<p>
				When a team plants explosives next to a construction objective the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				defines where the explosives can be planted. Because some explosives have a 
				wide damage radius be careful not to create
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entities too close to each other.
			<p>
				The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>

				The track key functions like a group name. All entities with the same track key 
				as the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			will be constructed at the same time. This is important if you want players to 
			be warned to leave construction areas during the transparent stage of 
			construction. If you set entities via the script to the transparent 
			construction state then players will not get the warning message for 
			construction.

			The flag and construction crates mark the location of where the Engineers can

				The flag and construction crate models are made from
				<span class="code">misc_gamemodel</span>
			entities with targetname and scriptname keys so that they can be referred to by 
			the script.
			<p>
				Create a rough set of clip brushes which mirror the shape of the construction 
				crates model. Then create an origin brush, select all the previously created 
				clip brushes and converted them into a
				<span class="code">func_static</span>
				entity. Select the
				<span class="code">func_static</span>
			entity and set the targetname and scriptname keys so that it can be referred to 
			by the script.
			<p>
				Create the constructible objective from brushwork and position it a reasonable 
				distance from the construction crates model. Create an origin brush, select the 
				constructible objective brushwork and convert into a
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity.
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> If you want to create the constructible objective from a model 
				then use clip brushes for the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				instead. It's important that the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity is made from brushes because the explosive's radius has to hit 
			something.
			<p>
				Select the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity and set the targetname and scriptname keys so that it can be referred to 
				by the script and targeted by the
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
			entity. Set the spawnflags to the relevant team which can construct the 
			objective. (Only one team should be selected.)
			<p>
				Finally create a
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				<a href="glossary.html#brushentity">brushwork entity</a> around the 
				construction crates model and target it at the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity. Allow enough room for the Engineers to be able to move around the 
				construction while building. Setup all the relevant keys and spawnflags for the
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity as <a href="#toi">documented above</a>
			.
			<p>
				<a class="maintitle" name="scripting">Scripting</a><br>
			All constructive objectives require scripting to work. In order for Level 
			Designers to create maps for Enemy Territory they will need to learn how to 
			write scripts. This may be a simple case of cut and paste from the original 
			scripts or may involve creating new script content.
			<p>
			In order to explain scripting this documentation defines certain words with 
			regards to scripting. Wherever possible certain words/phrases have been 
			hyperlinked to a glossary.
			<p>
			Here follows a quick primer on the how, where and what of scripting. This is by 
			no means a complete guide to scripting but all of the maps that come with the 
			original game do have script files which can be used as examples. Open them up 
			and have a look .
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Back to Basics</span><br>
			The script file is located in the maps directory with a ".script" file 
			extension. The script filename has to be the same as the map filename. (Eg. 
			'oasis.bsp', 'oasis.script')
			<p>
			The script file is made up of routines which define what various entities do 
			and how they react to game events. Each entity in the map has the possibility 
			to run a routine in the script file. To enable an entity to run a routine in 
			the script file it needs a targetname and scriptname key with relevant values.
			<p>
				For example:
				<span class="code">targetname</span>, "alliedmgnest" and
				<span class="code">scriptname</span>
			, "alliedmgnest".
			<p>
			It's recommended that the targetname and scriptname values are the same so it's 
			easier to debug the script and map for possible errors. (Technically not all of 
			the entities require the targetname and scriptname keys to be defined but it's 
			recommended)
			<p>
				Each entity <a href="glossary.html#routine">routine</a> is broken down into <a href="glossary.html#function">
					functions</a>
			which are triggered by various game events. For example: The function spawn is 
			triggered when the entity is spawned into the map at the beginning of the game.
			<p>
				Certain <a href="glossary.html#function">functions</a>
			exist for all entities regardless of what type they are. The standard functions 
			are spawn, trigger, pain and death. Some entities have further functions which 
			are specific to what they can do in game.
			<p>
			The script can run several entity routines at once, but each routine can only 
			run one function at once. For example if any function uses a wait command it 
			will stop all other functions for that entity routine. Because of this 
			limitation several entities maybe required in order to perform several tasks at 
			once.
			<p>
				Each entity routine can use / define up to 8 <a href="glossary.html#localvar">local 
					variables</a>. These local variables cannot be referenced outside of the 
				defining routine. The script system also supports up to 10 <a href="glossary.html#globalvar">
					global variables</a>
			which can be used / referenced by any routine / function in the same script.
			<p>
			Script variables can be used to store values which can determine if game events 
			have been completed or what state they are currently in. For example in the map 
			'Radar' a variable is used to count the total amount of radar parts taken from 
			the axis base.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Construction Script Functions</span><br>
				The func_constructible entity has 5 basic <a href="glossary.html#function">functions</a>
			as defined below:
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">spawn:</td>
						<td>This function is run the first time upon starting the map. All spawn functions 
							should have a wait command before processing any other commands because not all 
							entities are initially ready when the map is first loaded.
							<p>
								All constructible items in Enemy Territory must setup their construction class 
								when they spawn. This determines how much 'charge bar' time to be used while 
								constructing. (There are currently 3 types of <a href="#conclasses">construction 
									classes</a>
							defined.)
							<p>
							The construction materials should be made visible (default) and the main 
							construction elements made invisible.<p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">buildstart:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been started. The various 
							construction elements are set up to be displayed in a translucent state. This 
							shows all players where the construction is going to be built.<p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">built:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been finished. All 
							construction materials are made invisible and the main construction elements 
							are visible.
							<p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">decayed:</td>
						<td>If the construction has not been touched by an engineer for 30 seconds (current 
							default) then this function is called. The construction elements are made 
							invisible. If this function is not defined then the construction will remain in 
							a translucent state.<p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">death:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been destroyed. All 
							construction materials are made visible and the main construction elements are 
							made invisible.
							<p>
							If the construction involves a MG entity then it must be repaired by the script 
							at this point. If the MG entity was damaged during the destruction of the 
							construction object then the MG will be built in a damaged state.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The backbone of the construction system is one script command called
				<span class="code">setstate</span>
			. This command allows entities to be switched into 3 different states of 
			'default / invisible / underconstruction'. Combined with the various functions 
			defined above the construction system is not overly complex to setup.
			<p>
				<a class="maintitle" name="neutralteam">Neutral Team</a><br>
				A neutral construction is no different to a single stage construction except 
				there is one for each team, both linked to one
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity. The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity can only be associated to one team so neutral constructions need two 
			constructible entities.
			<p>
				It is recommended that both team constructions are different so that the 
				players can easily tell from a distance who built the construction in the first 
				place. The
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity controls which
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			is built and which script routine is active.
			<p>
				<a class="maintitle" name="multistage">Multiple Stages</a><br>
			The construction system can support up to 3 different stages for construction 
			(stage1, stage2, final) and 2 different stages for destruction. Depending on 
			which happens to the func_constructible depends on which stage will be active 
			as the diagram below illustrates:
			<p>
				<center><img src="images/construct.jpg"></center>
			<p>
			The best way to make a multiple staged construction is to create the final 
			object first and set it up like a single staged construction. Once you have a 
			single stage construction working then add more stages to it.
			<p>
			Multiple stage constructions use two new keys for the func_constructible 
			entity.
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>constages:</td>
						<td>List of construction
							<span class="code">func_brushmodel</span>
							entities.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>constages:</td>
						<td>List of destruction
							<span class="code">func_brushmodel</span>
							entities.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				All additional construction/destruction stages need to be setup as
				<span class="code">func_brushmodel</span>
				entities with
				<span class="code">targetname</span>
				key. The value of the targetname key will appear in the
				<span class="code">constages</span>
				or
				<span class="code">desstages</span>
			lists.
			<p>
				For example if the construction stage 1 and 2 entities have
				<span class="code">targetname</span>
				key values of 'constage1' and 'constage2', then the
				<span class="code">constages</span>
				key for the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			will have a value of 'constage1;constage2;'
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> The
				<span class="code">constages</span>,
				<span class="code">desstages</span>
			lists must be separated by semicolons and have no spaces. Only need to use 
			these keys if creating multiple stage constructions.
			<p>
				Wherever the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			is in the map, all the construction/deconstruction stages will appear as well. 
			It does not matter if you create the stages elsewhere in the map or at the same 
			space, all stages will be displayed at the same location.
			<p>
			The last stage in a multiple construction is always referred to as 'final' in 
			the script. If you are only creating a 2 stage construction then the script 
			will use 'stage1' and 'final' only.

				<b>Note:</b> Each stage has four <a href="glossary.html#function">functions</a> 
				which are run depending on the state of the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity. Some of the functions in this example script don't actually do anything 
			but are included so that you can use them if you want.
			<p>
			The final stage of construction is always called 'final', so if you require 
			only 2 stages of construction then only use 'stage1' and 'final' sections of 
			the above sample script. </font>
