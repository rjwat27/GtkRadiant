			<span class="maintitle">Compiling Maps</span><br>
			Before a map can be played in-game, it must be compiled. This is similar to 
			compiling a C program into an executable, or baking dough into bread. The map 
			editor, SDRadiant, operates on map files, and the game reads bsp files. 
			Generating a bsp from a map is a 3-stage process:
			<ul>
				<li>
				The BSP phase, where the brushes are used to create a BSP-tree and renderable 
				surfaces are generated
				<li>
				The Vis phase (-vis) where visibility processing is done
				<li>
				The Light phase (-light) where the map is illuminated, generating lightmaps and 
				setting vertex colours
			</ul>
			While Enemy Territory is based on the Quake 3 engine, and mapping for it is 
			similar to RtCW, there are certain engine/rendering features which require 
			slightly different compile-time options. To compile our levels, we used SDMap2, 
			which is an enhanced version of Q3Map2 with Enemy Territory specific features.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Key Differences</span><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Enemy Territory supports up to 1024 vertices per renderable surface and up to 
					2048 triangles. This is up from 1000 vertices per surface in Quake 3 or RTCW, 
					and up from 64 vertices on lightmapped surfaces. Note this limitation does not 
					apply to patch meshes.
					<li>
					Foliage surfaces, created with the Enemy Territory foliage shader commands
					<li>
					Decals, set up with _decal entities projected onto the world
					<li>
					External lightmaps
				</ul>
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">BSP Phase</span><br>
				Enemy Territory maps must be compiled using the <b>-meta</b>
			switch. This switch creates large triangle meshes from brush faces, allowing 
			more complex scenes than RtCW with an equivalent vertex count. Mappers 
			experienced with Q3Map2 should already be familiar with this switch.
			<p>
				Depending on how your map is constructed, you may wish to use the <b>-mv</b> and
				<b>-mi</b> switches as well. The <b>-mv</b> switch specifies the maximum number 
				of vertices to support on meta (triangle) surfaces, while the <b>-mi</b> switch 
				specifies the maximum number of indexes. Triangles are composed of 3 indexes 
				apiece, so the -mi value divided by 3 is the max number of triangles per 
				surface. An example usage of these switches is: <b>-mv 1024 -mi 6144</b>
			<p>
				After the BSP phase is complete, assuming the map hasn't leaked, the following 
				files will have been created:
				<ul>
					<li>
					&lt;mapname&gt;.bsp (the compiled map)
					<li>
					&lt;mapname&gt;.prt (the portal file used by vis)
					<li>
					&lt;mapname&gt;.srf (the surface file used by light)
				</ul>
				<b>Note:</b>
			The prt and srf files do not need to be included with the map when you release 
			it. They are temporary files only used by SDMap2.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Vis Phase (-vis)</span><br>
				The vis phase is equivalent to Quake 3 and RtCW. It can be run with the <b>-fast</b>
				switch for cruder visibility processing, but should always be run in 'full' 
				mode (no options) for a final compile. On maps with fog/farplane clipping, put 
				a <b>farplanedist</b> key on the worldspawn entity with a value that 
				corresponds to the distance at which the fog fades out, for example <b>1024</b>
			. This will enable the vis phase to stop visibility processing beyond that 
			distance. This can help make large, open maps more efficient, both in terms of 
			stuff drawn and network overhead.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Light Phase (-light)</span><br>
			The light phase typically takes the most time. Depending on how the map is lit, 
			how many brushes there are, how much sky, models, and various compile options, 
			the light phase can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.
			<p>
				For our maps, we used the following basic switches:<br>
				<b>-light -fast -samples 2 -filter -bounce 8 -external -lightmapsize 256 -approx 8</b>
			<p>
				The <b>-fast</b>
			switch is OK to use for final compiles, as long as you've been designing your 
			lighting around it. The only difference between -fast and a non-fast compile is 
			how SDMap2 handles area (shader) lights. They are typically a bit dimmer at 
			distance with -fast.
			<p>
				The <b>-samples 2</b> (or 3 or 4, etc) enables adaptive 'smart' antialiasing of 
				shadow edges. It's like the old <b>-extra</b>
			command, but takes 1/4 the memory and is only about 1.5x the time as a normal 
			compile. This switch is usually for final compiles only.
			<p>
				The <b>-filter</b>
			switch enables box filtering of lightmap data, similar to how Photoshop's 
			guassian blur works. Some maps look good with -filter and some don't. It's a 
			personal choice.
			<p>
				Radiosity is enabled with the <b>-bounce N</b> switch, where N is the number of 
				iterations you wish SDMap2 to bounce light around. It simulates the diffuse 
				light interaction between surfaces by reflecting light off everything. If you 
				shine a white light on a red wall, for instance, it will reflect red light. The 
				colour reflected is taken from the texture, or the shader's <b>qer_editorimage</b>
				or <b>q3map_lightimage</b>. The <b>-bounce</b>
			switch is usually for final compiles only, as it generates thousands of lights 
			with every iteration and can take hours to finish. However, at any point after 
			the initial lighting phase is complete and the radiosity stages have begun, you 
			can cancel compilation and the map will be lit up to the point at which it was 
			cancelled.
			<p>
				Enemy Territory maps were generally much larger than their Q3 or RtCW 
				counterparts, and generated tons of lighting data. To combat this, we used 
				three special switches:<b>-external</b>, <b>-lightmapsize</b>, and 
				</b>-approx</b>.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>-external -lightmapsize 256</b> instructs SDMap2 to output lightmap data in 
						the form of TGA images in the maps/<mapname>/ directory, with a width and height of 256 pixels. Our terrain shaders used 512x512 lightmaps, but generally don't use anything larger.
<li><b>-approx 8</b>
					sets the vertex-light approximation for lightmapped surfaces. If a surface is 
					too small (less than the size of a lightmap pixel) or has no discernable shadow 
					detail, then its lightmap will be discarded and the surface will be vertex lit. 
					This can be a substantial memory saver on some maps.
				</ul>

				<span class="smalltitle">Converting BSP's to ASE Models</span><br>
			A lot of the geometry in Enemy Territory, such as arches, rocks, pillars and 
			other bits were brushes/patches converted to models. Since rotating brushes 
			tends to screw up texturing, this was a method for our mappers to quickly build 
			geometry in Radiant and place it in maps at odd angles or scales.
			<p>
			To convert a map to an ASE model (3DS Max ASCII Scene Export), it first must be 
			compiled into a BSP. Place the geometry you wish to convert in a caulk box with 
			a single entity (usually a player start). Then compile it with the following 
			options:
			<p>
				<b>-meta -patchmeta -mv 1024 -mi 6144</b>
			<p>
				The <b>-patchmeta</b>
			option is important because ASE models don't support patch meshes directly-only 
			triangle/brush surfaces. You can have models in the map as well, they will 
			convert to ASE the same as brush faces. Note: no vis or light phase is 
			necessary.
			<p>
			Then to convert the BSP to an ASE, use the following command:
			<p>
				<b>-convert</b>
			<p>
			SDMap2 will output an ASE file next to the BSP file that can now be loaded in 
			3DS Max or used as a misc_model entity in another map.
			<p>
