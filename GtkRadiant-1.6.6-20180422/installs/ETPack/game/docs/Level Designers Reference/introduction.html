			This document is a basic primer for creating maps for Wolfenstein: Enemy 
			Territory. It assumes that you have downloaded and installed the editing tools 
			correctly and know how to use the GtkRadiant editor. So that all future 
			upgrades of the GtkRadiant editor do not affect the Enemy Territory editing 
			tools the editor executable has been renamed to SDRadiant.
			<p>
				There are plenty of tutorials on the Internet on how to use the GtkRadiant 
				editor. A good place to start would be the <a href="http://www.qeradiant.com" target="_blank">
					www.qeradiant.com</a>
			site. The editor also has an extensive collection of links in the help 
			documentation. (Press F1 inside of the editor)
			<p>
			At the back of this documentation is a glossary which defines certain technical 
			terms used through out this manual. At relevant points certain words are 
			hyperlinked to the glossary so that it is easier to understand what is being 
			said.
			<p>
				<b>This manual is not a beginner's guide to mapping.</b>
			<p>
			Enemy Territory is based on existing RtCW technology and assumes the reader is 
			familiar with the previous system. This manual only describes the new features 
			of Enemy Territory. There are plenty of forums and tutorials which can help 
			with the learning of the basics of mapping.

				<span class="maintitle">Key Differences between Enemy Territory and RtCW</span><br>
				Enemy Territory introduces a lot of new features and gameplay strategies. If 
				you are planning on converting an existing RtCW map to Enemy Territory then 
				consider the following points:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The spawning system is simpler and uses fewer entities.</li>
					<li>
						Command posts. (either neutral or individual)</li>
					<li>
						Health/ammo cabinets. (Can be linked to constructions if necessary)</li>
					<li>
						Map objectives should be set up to use the limbo camera system.</li>
					<li>
						The construction system is a critical component in Enemy Territory and all maps 
						should be designed with this feature in mind. (This a feature of the Engineer 
						class only)</li>
					<li>
						Command map - all maps need to define the co-ordinates of the command map so 
						that the map will load correctly and work with the limbo menu.</li>
					<li>
						Maps loaded from the in-game menu system need an arena file.</li>
					<li>
						Enemy Territory supports script moveable objects. (vehicles)</li>
					<li>
						Environmental effects like rain/snow.</li>
					<li>
						New fog system which works with multiple pass shaders and lightmapped terrain.</li>
					<li>
						Support for model foliage via a special shader. (Compiler option)</li>
					<li>
						A new class has been added to Enemy Territory called CovertOps. Team doors 
						should be added to critical choke points in maps so some objectives can be 
						bypassed.</li>
					<li>
						The terrain system can have external lightmaps and decals.</li>
					<li>
						All maps need a special "trace map" for the mortar and environmental effects to 
						work.</li>
					<li>
						The shader language supports implicit shaders. This can affect how models and 
						surfaces are lit in the game.</li>
					<li>
						New scripting commands to enhance the existing RtCW system.</li>
					<li>
						New compiler and Gtk plug-ins and features.</li>
					<li>
						Land Mines and new surface parameters.</li>
				</ul>
