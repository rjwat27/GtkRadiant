			<span class="maintitle">Moving Object Scripting</span><br>
			Making a moving object objective requires many interconnected entities and 
			scripting, especially if it needs to be damageable.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Triggers</span><br>
				To allow people to move the object, and see it displayed on the command map, 
				requires a few triggers: a
				<span class="code">trigger_multiple</span>
				entity for movement and a
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
			entity for the command map.
			<p>
				The <a href="glossary.html#keys">keys</a> you will need to set on the
				<span class="code">trigger_multiple</span>
			are:
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">targetname:</td>
						<td>The name used in the script for referencing this entity.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">scriptname:</td>
						<td>The <a href="glossary.html#routine">routine</a> name in the script file.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">target:</td>
						<td>This should be the
							<span class="code">targetname</span>
							of the
							<span class="code">target_script_trigger</span>
							entity used to control the movement, which will be described later.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				You may also want to set some of the <a href="glossary.html#spawnflag">spawnflags</a>
			, to allow only one team, or one class, the ability to move the object.
			<p>
				The <a href="glossary.html#keys">keys</a> you will need to set on the
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
			are:
			<p>
				<table>

						<td class="code" valign="top">targetname:</td>
						<td>The name used in the script for referencing this entity.</td>

			<p>
				You must set the tank <a href="glossary.html#spawnflag">spawnflag</a>
			for this to show up correctly, and if the object is to be destroyed, the team 
			that owns the object must be chosen from the objective spawnflags.
			<p>
				The
				<span class="code">trigger_multiple</span>
				should be a fairly large area around the object, whilst the
				<span class="code">
			trigger_objective_info</span>
			should just fit around the edges, thus only allowing people to construct it 
			when very close to it.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Building, Destroying and the Object Itself</span><br>
				The object itself is made from a
				<span class="code">script_mover</span>
				entity. This is best made out of clip brushes, with a
				<span class="code">model2</span>
			key supplied to use an external md3 model.
			<p>
				The <a href="glossary.html#keys">keys</a>

				</table>
			<p>
				There are various spawnflags which should be set, and some which must be set. 
				You must have the
				<span class="code">resurrectable</span>
				flag set and in most cases you will want solid to be set as well. If the object 
				is to be damageable, the appropriate team button should be selected for who 
				owns the object. The compass flag should be set if the object is to show on the 
				compass. If the object is only to be destructible using explosive weapons, the
				<span class="code">explosivedamageonly</span>
				flag must be set. Last of all, if you want to attach a gun to the object, the
				<span class="code">mounted_gun</span>
			flag must be set.
			<p>For damage and repair of the object to work, you must have a
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>

			<p>
				The

			The appropriate team should again be chosen for the team that is to own the 
			object.

			The control of the object via scripting may look complex at first, but it is in 
			fact quite simple. The examples below are taken from the 'Fueldump' script if 
			you wish to take a look over the whole script.
			<p>
			First off, you have the two script trigger routines, which tell the tank 
			whether there is someone in the trigger or not.
			<p>
				<table width="90%" align="center">

						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The 'tank_enabler' routine will call the trigger run function while there are 
				players standing within the trigger, and the 'tank_disabler' will call its 
				trigger run function every time the
				<span class="code">func_timer</span>
			activates, i.e. once per second. These two functions just keep the tank object 
			informed about players being in the trigger or not, and it will make decisions 
			based on this information.
			<p>
			Now we'll take a look at what the tank does with this information.

			<p>
				First off, it calls the trigger 'stuck_check' function (which will be explained 
				later), which will set bit 3 of
				<span class="code">accum 1</span>
			if the object is stuck. If it is stuck, it aborts, as movement is not possible.
			<p>
				Next, it resets the counter (<span class="code">accum 4</span>) which would 
				stop the vehicle from moving if there was no-one there, and resets the counter 
				that says we shouldn't be moving any more (<span class="code">accum 1 bit 8</span>
			).
			<p>
			Next it aborts if we were already following a path, as you don't want the 
			startup stuff to happen if already moving.
			<p>
				Next, it will abort if a script_lockout (<span class="code">accum 5</span>, 
				more information later) is in place, or if the tank has been damaged (<span class="code">accum 1 bit 7</span>
			).
			<p>
				If it passes all of these checks, then the tank has just started moving, and so 
				it calls all the sound startup and animation startup functions. As it has some 
				waits to have the animation work properly, a
				<span class="code">script_lockout</span>
			is put in place so that nothing can interrupt this sequence. After the startup 
			is complete, it then calls the 'trigger move' function, to commence movement 
			along a path.
			<p>
			The disabler routine below is fairly simple.
			<p>
				<table width="90%" align="center">
					<tr>
						<td class="codeblock">
							trigger tank_disable<br>
							{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accum 4 inc 1 // up the stop counter<br>

							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accum 1 bitset 8 // set stop check<br>
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger self deathcheck<br>
							}<br>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				Every time this is called (once per second),
				<span class="code">accum 4</span>
				is incremented. If the value of
				<span class="code">accum 4</span>
				is below 4, then the function does nothing more.
				<span class="code">Accum 4</span>
				will be reset by the enabler function as long as the tank is not stuck, and 
				someone is in the trigger. If the tank is stuck, or no-one is in the trigger, 
				then the
				<span class="code">accum</span>
				will be allowed to continue incrementing, up to the value of 4 and beyond. Once 
				it reaches this stage, the rest of the function will be allowed to execute, and 
				the stopped moving flag (<span class="code">accum 1 bit 8</span>
			) will be set. This also then calls the 'trigger deathcheck' function, to be 
			sure that something is checking whether the tank has been damaged enough to go 
			into its broken state.

			The 'trigger move' function will be called from the 'tank_enabler' event upon

			then call the 'trigger dispatch' function which will in turn select the 
			appropriate 'run_XXX' function to move from its current position. If the 
			'trigger move_check' function fails because the tank is stuck, then execution 
			will return to the 'trigger move' function. The function will wait 500ms and

			), then issues the command for the turret to move (as it isn't attached using a 
			tag in this case), and then issue its own move command. After this has

			These functions, plus several more not outlined here, form a set of functions 
			that check whether the tank can move or not.
			<p>
				The 'trigger stuck_check' function first resets
				<span class="code">accum 1 bit 3</span>
			, which it uses as an indicator to say whether or not the tank is in fact 
			stuck. Since we are resetting it every time, we are assuming that the tank is 
			not stuck unless we are told otherwise, which is the easiest way to handle 
			things. Next, it calls the functions for each individual reason for being 
			stuck, such as the bridge not being built, or it having finished its entire run 
			across the map.
			<p>
				These extra functions simply check to make sure they are valid, usually by 
				checking the position indicator, and any other data they may need to know 
				about. If those checks don't fail, then they set
				<span class="code">accum 1 bit 3</span>, as an indicator that the tank is in 
				fact stuck. Now, no matter what any of the other events do (assuming they don't 
				reset
				<span class="code">accum 1 bit 3</span>, which they shouldn't ever do), the 
				flag will remain set when the 'trigger stuck_check' function exits. Other 
				functions can use this to check whether the tank is stuck by simply calling the 
				'trigger stuck_check' function, then checking the value of
				<span class="code">accum 1 bit 3</span>

				The 'trigger death' function simply sets
				<span class="code">accum 1 bit 7</span>
			to on, as a flag for the 'trigger deathcheck' function, so that it knows that 
			the tank's health has reached 0.
			<p>
			The 'trigger deathcheck' function does a few checks at the beginning before 
			changing the model, and playing the shutdown sequence. These checks are: making 
			sure the health has hit 0, the tank hasn't already been made to look broken, 
			the tank isn't moving, and the tank isn't in a script lockout. As before, it 
			initiates a script lockout during the shutdown process.
			<p>
				This also fires the
				<span class="code">target_kill</span>
				entity, which is used to damage the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity, making the
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity become active, and so, allowing people to rebuild the constructible, 
				which in turn, will activate the
				<span class="code">script_mover</span>
			entity which will call the 'rebirth' function below.
