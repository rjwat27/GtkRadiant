			<span class="maintitle">Foliage Technology</span><br>
			Wolfenstein Enemy Territory adds a new feature to the Quake 3 engine's shader 
			repertoire, the ability to automatically place detail models directly onto map 
			surfaces in an algorithmic fashion. They are designed primarily for foliage, 
			hence the name, but can be used for adding pebbles or rocks scattered randomly 
			around terrain.
			<p>
			One key feature of foliage is that it will fade out over distance, but this can 
			cause a problem looking at players at a distance. It is suggested that 
			additional trees and tall bushes are added to the landscape to offer other 
			forms of permanent cover.
			<p>
			When creating foliage, there are 3 things to set up: the foliage model, the 
			foliage model's shader(s), and changes to any existing shader where foliage is 
			desired on.
			<p>
				Foliage is compiled into the BSP hence it is <b>static</b>
			. If you need to change the foliage in your map, it must be recompiled. This is 
			done for performance reasons -- when foliage is loaded by Enemy Territory it is 
			compiled into a list for fast rendering.
			<p>
			To compile foliage into a map, SDMap2 (Q3Map2) 2.3.32 or higher is required.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Adding Foliage to Existing Shaders</span><br>
			There is a new shader directive 'q3map_foliage' that specifies how SDMap2 
			applies foliage to a surface. It takes this form:
			<p>
				<table width="90%" align="center">
					<tr>
						<td class="codeblock">
							q3map_foliage &lt;model&gt; &lt;scale&gt; &lt;density&gt; &lt;odds&gt; &lt;use 
							inverse alpha&gt;<br>
							<br>
							q3map_foliage models/foliage/grass_5.md3 1.0 16 0.025 0<br>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">model:</td>
						<td>models/foliage/grass_5.md3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">scale:</td>
						<td>1.0. This is normal size, 0.5 would be half size, 2.0 would be double</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">density:</td>
						<td>T16 units. This is the smallest chunk Q3Map will divide a surface up into 
							before it tries to place a foliage instance.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">odds:</td>
						<td>0.025. This means that a random 2.5% of the potential spots for foliage will be 
							placed. Typically you want to use small values for this; otherwise you will end 
							up with ridiculously high polygon counts.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">inverse alpha:</td>
						<td>0. this means to use the straight vertex alpha as a scaling factor against the 
							odds of appearing. This is so that terrain shaders with multiple blending 
							layers can have different foliage on each style and have them fade/blend 
							properly together.</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
			If you have brush on terrain0 and grass on terrain1, then the blend shader 
			would have two q3map_foliage directives like this:
			<p>
				<table width="90%" align="center">
					<tr>
						<td class="codeblock">
							q3map_foliage models/foliage/brush.md3 1.0 16 0.025 1<br>
							q3map_foliage models/foliage/grass_5.md3 1.0 16 0.025 0<br>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
			Where the higher-numbered terrain layer/shader uses normal vertex alpha to 
			modulate the odds-of-occurring and the lower-numbered layer uses inverse alpha.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Creating a Foliage Model</span><br>
			Foliage models should be kept simple and small. Since they're entirely 
			decorative and non-solid, you should avoid making a foliage model that looks as 
			if it could block the player.
			<p>
			For best results, make your models in Max or Maya as a single object (multiple 
			objects will slow down rendering) with a single texture/shader, and try to keep 
			the polygon count as low as possible. Our initial test foliage models were only 
			6 triangles apiece. When there are a few thousand foliage instances on-screen, 
			the small numbers can add up, so be thrifty.
