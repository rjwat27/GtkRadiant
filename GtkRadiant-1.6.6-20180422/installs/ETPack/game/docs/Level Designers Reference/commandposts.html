			The command post is an essential object on the map which should be constructed 
			and carefully defended because of its tremendous benefits to 'charge bar' 
			times. It should be placed with care on a map because it can tip the scales of 
			balance for one team over another.
			<p>
			The command post comes in two different variants: individual team or neutral 
			team. The neutral team version is the most complex to set up because it 
			involves so many different components. The command post totally relies on 
			scripting to work, so using the existing scripts as a template will save you 
			loads of time.

				The command post is essential a
				<span class="code">func_constructible entity</span>
			with three different models for visual representation. The command post models 
			are setup as game_models so that they can be swapped in and out of the game 
			easily. Each separate section of the command post has targetname and scriptname 
			keys so that they can be referred to by the script system.
			<p>
				All constructible items in Enemy Territory must have a
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				entity. When the player is near the
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
			entity a message is displayed on screen. Whatever is defined in the track key 
			is used as the onscreen text message.
			<p>
				Important note: The
				<span class="code">trigger_objective_info</span>
				is a <a href="glossary.html#brushentity">brushwork entity</a>
			and must contain an origin brush; otherwise it will appear half way between its 
			current map position and '0 0 0' map position on the command map.
			<p>
				In order for the command post to appear on the command map as a constructible 
				item it must be linked to a certain entity type. The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity tells Enemy Territory who owns the construction (Allies/Axis), what 
			state it starts in and if it can be destroyed or not.
			<p>
				The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity defines where the explosives can be put by the player so that the 
				construction is destroyed. Because of this restriction the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity is usually the same physical size as the command post when built. The 
				clip brush used for the 'built' command post game model is setup as a
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity.
			<p>
			For each command post game model a rough set of clip brushes will need to be 
			created to mirror the shape of the model. All the command posts in the current 
			Enemy Territory maps were setup with roughly the correct metal/wood clip 
			brushes.
			<p>
				Once all the clip brushes have been created an origin brush will need to be 
				added and then everything converted into a
				<span class="code">script_mover</span>
				entity. Because the clip brushes for the 'built' game model were used as a
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
				entity, only the 'closed' and 'damaged' clip brushes will need to be converted 
				to
				<span class="code">script_mover</span>
			entities.
			<p>
				<span class="smalltitle">Entity summary</span><br>
				3 command post game models (Allied, Axis and Neutral)<br>

			(all command posts are secondary objectives)
			<p>
			All the above entities need targetname and scriptname keys and with that many 
			inter-linked entities to keep track of it can get confusing. The command posts 
			behave in a similar way across most of the maps and if the key/values are 
			standard then it makes referring to them in the script easier. Here is a list 
			of standard names that were used with the command posts.

				The primary entity for controlling the construction/deconstruction of the 
				command post is the func_constructible entity. This entity has many <a href="glossary.html#function">
					functions</a>
			as summarised below:
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">spawn:</td>
						<td>This function is run the first time upon starting the map. All spawn functions 
							should have a wait command before processing any other commands because not all 
							entities are initially ready when the map is first loaded.
							<p>
								All constructible items in Enemy Territory must setup their construction class 
								when they spawn. This determines how much 'charge bar' time to be used while 
								constructing. (There are currently 3 types of <a href="construction.html#conclasses">
									construction classes</a>
							defined.)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">setup:</td>
						<td>This is a custom trigger function which sets the initial speed at which the 
							'charge bar' is replenished. (Called by the spawn function)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">buildstart:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been started. The 'destroyed' 
							and "closed" game models are hidden and the 'built' game model is displayed in 
							a translucent state.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">built:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been finished. The 'built' 
							game model is displayed and the command post features are enabled. The 'charge 
							bar' times are adjusted, team VO updated, command post status changed and the 
							secondary objective completed/failed for the relevant team.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">decayed:</td>
						<td>If the construction is not completed within 30 seconds (current default) then 
							this function is called. The construction will be reset back to a 'closed' or 
							'damaged' game model state.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="code" valign="top">death:</td>
						<td>This function is called once the construction has been destroyed. The 
							'destroyed' game model is displayed and the command post features are disabled. 
							The 'charge bar' times are adjusted, team VO updated, command post status 
							changed and the secondary objective reset. (The tick/cross overlay is removed)</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
				The clip brush
				<span class="code">script_mover</span>
				entities are mainly controlled from the
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity. They control the relevant game_models entities and switch states 
			depending on what is happening with the command post.
			<p>
				Finally the 'built' game model is used for enabling/disabling the command post 
				features. The 'charge bar' times are adjusted for all classes and the VO is 
				updated for the relevant team. The
				<span class="code">sethqstatus</span>
			script command will inform all team members about landmines being close by. 
			(Command post feature)
			<p>
				When the command post is constructed / damaged a sound speaker entity 
				(positioned infront of the command post) which is enabled / disabled via the 
				script using new commands. All the speaker sounds in the maps where placed by 
				the <a href="speakereditor.html">new speaker sound system</a>
			built into the game executable. </font>
