			<span class="maintitle">Dual Objectives</span><br>
			The original RtCW used screenshot images to display to the player where they 
			should be going to complete the map objectives. Generally Enemy Territory 
			involves a lot more objectives and constantly maintaining these images during 
			the development of the maps was time consuming and resource-hungry.
			<p>
			The solution was to create a virtual camera system which could be setup to 
			point at objectives or spawn areas throughout the map. As dynamic objectives 
			were used for the escort-a-tank missions, the system was also extended to allow 
			chase cameras as well.
			<p>
			Below is a screenshot from the Limbo menu featuring the various command map 
			icons, filters down the right and the objective description/camera viewpoint 
			along the bottom.
			<p>

			When the player clicks on the spawnpoint icons on the command map the game will 
			update the camera viewpoint at the bottom of the screen.
			<p>
			When the player cycles through the objectives with the up and down arrows the 
			camera will change to reflect what they are looking at.
			<p>
			Critical objectives will make the icon pulsate slowly so players know they are 
			important and they can find them on the command map easier.
			<p>
				The objective camera entity
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			has to target another entity; otherwise Enemy Territory will not load the map. 
			This is something to be careful of if you region compile maps. (You can add 
			entities to compiled maps with the "-onlyents" option.)
			<p>
				To create a spawn room camera you will need to setup the
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
				entity to target the
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
				entity. Also remember to give the
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			entity a targetname so that it can be removed from the game if need be. Often 
			forward spawn areas are removed in LMS.
			<p>
				For each objective in the map you will need to create an
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
				entity and target it at an
				<span class="code">info_null</span>
				entity. The info_null is used as the direction the camera will be looking. The
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			entity must also have an objective key which tells the game what camera is 
			looking at what objective.
			<p>
				The final use for the
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
				entity is to follow a moving objective like for example the tank in Goldrush or 
				Fueldump. In the map Fueldump the tank (<span class="code">script_mover</span>
			entity) is made from various clip brushes which all the camera entities target.
			<p>
				At various points on the tanks journey are
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			entities which are used to watch the tank. They all target the tank entity 
			regardless of how far away they are from the tank initially.
			<p>
				As the tank (<span class="code">script_mover</span>) goes past each
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			entity, the camera viewpoint on the limbo menu focuses on the tank during its 
			journey. The camera will pan around and watch the tank at all times.
			<p>
				Which ever
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
				entity the tank (<span class="code">script_mover</span>) is closest to, will be 
				used as the current camera location. With some clever placement of the
				<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
			entities you can create some really cool angles. In the map 'Goldrush' the tank 
			is shown rolling over the bridge towards the market, but from the angle of 
			someone standing in the courtyard in front of the bank. </font>
		<p>
			<span class="maintitle">Description Text</span><br>
		All the objective/map text is stored in a separate file called '&lt;map 
		name&gt;.objdata' in the 'maps' folder. This was done because some of the 
		objective text needed was special international characters.
		<p>
			The first 3 lines of the file deal with the text for Axis/Allied/Spectator 
			teams. These lines of text are referred to as objective 0 by the
			<span class="code">info_limbo_camera</span>
		entities.
		<p>
		Each team must have an equal amount of text descriptions for each objective in 
		the map. The total number of objectives is still set in the map script file.
		<p>
		Once the objectives are completed or failed they are updated with an alpha 
		channel image stored in 'ui/assets2' called 'stamp_complete.tga' or 
		'stamp_failed.tga'.
		<p>
			<span class="maintitle">News Reel</span><br>
		Each map has a WAV file which is used to read a news bite introducing the map 
		as if from an old style newsreel. The wav file is stored in the following area:
		<p>
		/sound/vo/&lt;map name&gt;/news_&lt;map name&gt;.wav
		<p><center><img src="images/objcameras_2.jpg"></center>
		<p>
		All maps have a sound script file which also defines the news reel WAV file at 
		the top. The scripts files are in the 'sound/scripts' folder and named after 
		the map name.
