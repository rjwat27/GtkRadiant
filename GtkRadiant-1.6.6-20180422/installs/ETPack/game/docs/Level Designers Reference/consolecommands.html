			The following console commands are useful when testing a map built for Enemy 
			Territory:
			<p><b>/cg_draw2d</b><br>
			This cvar command toggles the display of all the HUD elements except the gun.
			<p><b>/cg_drawfps</b><br>
			This cvar command toggles the display of the current frames per second that the 
			map is running at. This is displayed under the map timer.
			<p><b>/cg_drawgun</b><br>
			This cvar command toggles the display of the weapon model.
			<p><b>/cg_drawreinforcementtime</b><br>
			This cvar command toggles the display of the next respawn time. The counter is 
			displayed next to the map timer. Extremely useful for timing when the next wave 
			of team mates might arrive or when would be a good time to tap out to the limbo 
			menu for a respawn.<p>
			Cg_thirdperson 2 will keep the player model in view at all times. This is 
			extremely useful for checking the light values in a map because the player face 
			will reflect the density of the light grid. (You will also need to also change 
			the cg_thirdpersonangle to 180.)
			<p><b>/cg_thirdperson</b><br>
			Cg_thirdperson switches the player's viewpoint between first and third person. 
			This can be useful when checking new player skins/models and the relative scale 
			of the map geometry to the player model. The default value is 0 - first person.
			<p><b>/cg_thirdpersonangle</b><br>
			By default the thirdperson view is of the character from behind. Use 
			cg_thirdpersonangle to alter the angle at which the player model is viewed. The 
			angle is given in degrees where 0 is the default and a value of 180 degrees 
			will give the player a view directly from the front of the player model.
			<p><b>/cg_thirdpersonrange</b><br>
			The default distance that the player model appears from the camera when in 
			thirdperson perspective is 80 units. This value can be altered using 
			/cg_thirdpersonrange. The greater the value the further the camera will appear 
			from the player model.
			<p><b>/con_drawnotify</b><br>
			This command allows developer commands such as r_speeds to display in the main 
			game view and not just in the console. The command is toggled between 0 and 1 
			where 0 displays the developer commands in console only and 1 displays them 
			in-game also.
			<p><b>/con_notifytime</b><br>
			Ideally set to at least 5 this cvar allows the developer to determine how long 
			(in seconds) the command is displayed onscreen.
			<p><b>/g_scriptdebug</b><br>
			Prints to the server console every line of script that is executed, along with 
			the scriptname of the entity which is calling the script, and the time it was 
			executed at. This is extremely useful for tracking down strange script bugs.
			<p><b>/g_debugconstruct</b><br>
			This will speed up all construction times for quick construction checking.
			<p><b>/r_speeds</b><br>
			The r_speeds cvar displays rendering information which can be helpful in 
			determining what may be having an effect on fps. The default value is 0 which 
			will not display the r_speeds.
			<p>
			r_speeds 1 displays the following information:
			<p>
			xxx/xxx shaders/surfs xx leafs xxxxx verts xxxxx/xxxxx tris x.xx mtex x.xx dc
			<p>
			The renderer batches up drawsurfaces (map drawsurfaces, such as terrain chunks, 
			walls, floors, model sections; model surfaces like players and weapons, and 
			effect surfaces) into a large array before doing render passes. The "shaders" 
			value is actually how many batches there are. Each batch can require one or 
			more rendering pass. For example, weapon shaders often require two: a 
			diffuse/texture pass to add details and an environment pass to make them shiny.
			<p>
			The "surfs" value indicates the number of drawsurfaces visible.
			<p>
			The "leafs" value indicates the number of BSP leafs that are visible in the 
			scene. A leaf is the final, smallest BSP node which contains actual renderable 
			data.
			<p>
			The most important value, "verts" shows the number of vertexes batched up to be 
			rendered in the shader/batches to be calculated, transformed, lit etc. Ideally, 
			the verts count should be as close to 1024 x the shaders (batches) count. 
			Realistically, it will be difficult to achieve this target due to the amount of 
			unique shader effects that only get rendered once.
			<p>
			The number of triangles visible in the scene is indicated by the "tris" value. 
			Ideally the ratio of tris to verts should be as high as possible since you want 
			to maximize the number of tris compared to the number of verts.
			<p><b>/r_lightmap</b><br>
			Setting this cvar to 1 will turn off textures on light mapped surfaces so that 
			they appear white. This makes it easier to see how shadows affect these 
			surfaces. All drawn surfaces not pastel white are vertex lit and are not 
			affected by the external lightmaps.
			<p>
			R_lightmap 2 will re-colour the map surfaces in light intensity values. This 
			has to be done before the map is loaded. (3 does it in the logical red is hot 
			and has a higher intensity)
			<p><b>/r_shownormals</b><br>
			Normals indicate the direction a triangle is facing. Use r_shownormals to 
			display normals.
			<p>
				r_shownormals 1: shows you the vertex normals on everything being drawn<br>
			r_shownormals 2: shows you the origin, direction and colour of the lighting on 
			entities. This lets you debug the lightgrid.
			<p><b>/r_showtris</b><br>
			The r_showtris cvar displays the triangles drawn by the game engine. There are 
			three r_showtris levels: 0 - 2. The default value is 0 which does not display 
			triangles.
			<p>
				r_showtris 1 displays depth-buffered triangles, i.e. only those triangles which 
				can actually be seen. This lets the developer see the outline of brushes/models 
				more easily and is especially useful when checking un-VIS'd maps or those with 
				complex geometry.<br>
			r_showtris 2 displays all triangles in view which the engine is currently 
			rendering. (This is recognizable as the old Q3 r_showtris 1 cvar).
			<p><b>/r_triscolor</b><br>
			This cvar sets the colour of the triangles displayed by the r_showtris cvar. 
			The default value is "1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0" which will draw solid white lines around 
			all triangles drawn on screen. The first 3 values are the RBG colour and the 
			final value is the alpha-blend value. This command is useful if you are 
			debugging snow style maps which involve a lot of whiteness.
			<p><b>/god</b><br>
			In God mode the player will be invulnerable to anything in the map that would 
			normally hurt them, such as damage from a weapon, high falls or remaining under 
			water for long periods of time. Please note that some triggers in the game will 
			still hurt the player regardless of god like status. The trigger_hurt entity 
			has a spawnflag setting to override god player status.
			<p><b>/map_restart</b><br>
			This command will restart the level and will respawn the player. It will also 
			reload the script file for the map from disk again and reset all construction 
			items in a map. This is useful for tweaking and testing scripts without having 
			to reload the map from scratch each time.
			<p><b>/nofatigue</b><br>
			When the player is sprinting it will use up stamina. This is indicated by the 
			green bar on the lower right of the HUD. When it reaches the bottom the player 
			will slow down. By setting /nofatigue to 1 will allow the player to continue to 
			sprint even when out of stamina.
			<p><b>/noclip</b><br>
			Setting noclip to 1 allows the developer to pass through otherwise solid 
			geometry and anything that has been player-clipped.
			<p><b>/screenshot</b><br>
			Takes a screenshot from the current view and writes it to the 
			'etmain/screenshots' folder.
			<p><b>/timelimit</b><br>
			This command sets the length of time (in minutes) that the game will run for 
			before it automatically ends if the offensive objectives haven't been 
			completed. After this time the next level will load. If you need to test a map 
			over a long period of time then set timelimit to 0.
			<p><b>/timescale</b><br>
			Useful when checking large maps and scripted sequences, the timescale cvar will 
			alter the speed at which the game is running. A value of 2, for instance, will 
			run the map at twice the normal speed. (Please check the developer config's for 
			examples of how this command can be useful if bound to several keys.) </font>
