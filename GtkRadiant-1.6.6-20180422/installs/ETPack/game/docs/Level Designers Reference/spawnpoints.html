			The player spawning system in Enemy Territory has one spawn entity per team 
			with 2 spawnflag values as follows:
			<p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Classname:</td>
						<td class="code">team_CTF_redspawn, team_CTF_bluespawn</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Spawnflag:</td>
						<td class="code">invulnerable, startactive</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			<p>
			Generally an Enemy Territory map will have an initial spawn area for both teams 
			and possibly one or more capture/autospawn areas.
			<p>
			The initial spawn areas are made up of team-specific spawn entities with the 
			spawnflag values both set so that players can start the map without being 
			killed immediately.
			<p>
				The capture / autospawn areas will have Axis / Allied player spawn entities and 
				both sets should be given a targetname key. The targetname key is used so that 
				the game can switch the spawn entities from one state to another. Initially one 
				set will be active and the other set will be dormant until <a href="glossary.html#triggering">
					triggered</a>
			via the targetname key.
			<p>
				Located near all spawnpoints in the game is a
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
			entity which appears on the command map, determines who owns the spawnpoint 
			initially (If you select both spawnflag values then it WILL produce erratic 
			results) and has a description key used by the autospawn feature.
			<p>
				If the spawnpoints are spread out across a wide area or in several rooms then 
				the
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
				entity should be located somewhere in the middle of the spawnpoints. When the 
				game spawns a player it will choose the next available spawnpoint closest to 
				the
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
			entity. Some spawnpoints will not be used unless you have a lot of players 
			spawning at once. All spawn areas should be designed to cope with 16 players 
			spawning at once on each side.
			<p>
			The autospawn feature is designed to start players at the most forward spawn 
			point on the map for the relevant team. As spawn areas are captured temporarily 
			or permanently the script system needs to keep the autospawn feature up to 
			date.
			<p>
				The description key is used by the autospawn system to switch the state of the
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
				entity from one team to the next. The autospawn feature is totally controlled 
				via the script and does not switch spawnpoints around either. (You still need 
				to <a href="glossary.html#triggering">trigger</a>
			the spawnpoint entities as before)
			<p>
				The setautospawn command (used in the script) uses the description key of the
				<span class="code">team_WOLF_objective</span>
				entity to determine which spawn area to use, followed by a 0/1 value for which 
				team. 0 represents Axis and 1 is for the Allied. There is no default for the 
				setautospawn command so it needs to be setup at the beginning of the game, 
				usually located in the
				<span class="code">game_manager</span>
				<a href="glossary.html#routine">routine</a>
			of the script.
			<p>
				Please note that Enemy Territory maps still require the
				<span class="code">game_manager</span>
				entity to be present in all maps. The map script usually starts with the
				<span class="code">game_manager</span>
				<a href="glossary.html#routine">routine</a>
			because it always exists in every map.
			<p>
				<span class="maintitle">Spawn area considerations</span><br>
			Unfortunately there is a certain type of player who insists on disrupting 
			online games as much as possible. These tactics range from spawn camping to 
			door blocking and sadly these things can ruin a game for all people involved.
			<p>
			There is currently no way of "bumping" players out of the way in RtCW / Enemy 
			Territory and some players on public servers insist on disrupting games by 
			blocking doorways to / from spawn areas.
			<p>
				When designing spawn areas we considered the following points:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you can spare the space then create all spawn areas with at least two 
						entrance/exits so one player cannot block a whole spawn area.</li>
					<li>
						If you have only one entrance / exit to a spawn area then make it at least 3 
						players wide in order to prevent 1 player from blocking the doorway.</li>
					<li>
						Make sure that neither team can place landmines on the floor of the spawn area.</li>
					<li>
						Place all spawn entities as close as possible against a wall so that enemy 
						players cannot stand behind the spawn entities and spawn camp.</li>
					<li>
						If possible place spawn areas under cover so that mortar / artillery strikes 
						cannot affect new players joining the game.</li>
					<li>
						Remember to make sure all spawn entities have the spawnflag set to invulnerable 
						so that new players are not killed instantly upon spawning into the game.</li>
					<li>
						Try creating spawn areas high up so that the new players have a height 
						advantage over the opposing forces.</li>
					<li>
						Create multiple spawn locations for critical areas to minimize spawn camping 
						and door blocking.</li>
				</ul>
			No spawnpoint is entirely spam-proof. Regardless of how many features you build 
			into a spawn area to prevent disruptive game play, some players will always 
			find a way to spam it. All you can do is to try and prevent as many of the most 
			obvious problems associated with spawn areas as possible. </font>
