				<a class="smalltitle" name="pointentity">Entity (point)</a><br>
			An entity refers to a point in a map where a specific object exists. These 
			objects are defined by the entities definition file supplied with the editor 
			tools. Entities can be made of models, specific objects or brushes.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="brushentity">Entity (Brushwork)</a><br>
				Some entities require that they are made from brushes. Some special brushwork 
				entities require they are painted with texture/shaders from the common 
				directory. For example: A
				<span class="code">trigger_once</span>
			entity would be painted with the 'trigger' shader from the common directory.
			<p>
				<b>All brushwork entities should contain 'origin' brushes.</b>
			<p>
			Brushwork entities can also be areas in a map which the player can enter and 
			the game performs a certain event depending on what the entity does.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="key">Key</a><br>
				All entities have keys which define characteristics of the entity. Examples of 
				these keys are
				<span class="code">classname</span>,
				<span class="code">targetname</span>,
				<span class="code">target</span>
			, etc.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="value">Value</a><br>
			All entity keys should have a value by default, whether it is a number or 
			string. These values are usually defined / explained in the entities 
			description box of the editor.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="spawnflag">Spawnflag</a><br>
			A special key defined by a particular set of check boxes in the entity 
			definition dialog box. The selection of the checkboxes usually represents 
			binary values in the final key value.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="triggering">Triggering an Entity</a><br>
				To trigger an entity is to activate a certain state / specific function and it 
				varies from entity to entity. With spawnpoint entities they will be turn on or 
				off, while a
				<span class="code">func_explosion</span>
			will simple explode and be removed from the game. The only disadvantage to 
			triggering entities is that you cannot set the state of an entity to a specific 
			value with the trigger function.
			<p>
				In order to trigger an entity it must have a
				<span class="code">targetname</span>
				key/value so that the script system can refer to it. It's a good idea to make 
				the
				<span class="code">targetname</span>
			values more meaningful and not rely on the default 'txxxx' name system of the 
			editor. It can help with debugging of the map / script later on.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="pvs">PVS (Potentially Visible Set)</a><br>
			PVS is the set (group) of areas in a map which may or may not be visible from 
			the position at which you are currently standing. Each area is a convex volume, 
			the same as a brush is.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="routine">Scripting - Routine</a><br>
				The script file is made up of routines which define what various entities do 
				and how they react to game events. Each entity in the map has the possibility 
				to run a routine in the script file. To enable an entity to run a routine in 
				the script file give the entity a
				<span class="code">targetname</span>
				and
				<span class="code">scriptname</span>
			key with relevant values.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="function">Scripting - Function</a><br>
				Each entity routine is broken down into functions which are triggered by 
				various events which affect the entity. For example: The function 'spawn' is 
				triggered when the entity is spawned into the map at the beginning of the game. 
				Certain functions exist for all entities regardless of what type they are. The 
				standard functions are 'spawn', 'trigger', 'pain', 'death'. Some entities have 
				further functions which are specific to what they do in game. For example: The
				<span class="code">func_constructible</span>
			entity has the following unique functions: 'built', 'buildstart', 'decayed', 
			'destroyed' which are used when certain events happen involving that entity 
			type in game.
			<p>
				<a class="smalltitle" name="variables">Scripting - Variables</a><br>
				The scripting system supports the ability to keep track of variables or values. 
				The system has local and global variables and each are referenced differently. 
				The scripting system refers the keywords
				<span class="code">accum</span>
				and
				<span class="code">globalaccum</span>
			to mean variables. There is plenty of ways of testing these variables and 
			making scripting decisions based on their values.
			<p>
				<a name="localvar"><b>Local</b></a><br>
				Each routine can define 8 local variables (<span class="code">accum</span>) 
				which can be used by the routine for keeping track of local conditions. For 
				example, if the entity routine is a button, a local variable could keep track 
				of if the button is on or off. No other routines in the script can access these 
				local variables (<span class="code">accum</span>
			).
			<p>
				<a name="globalvar"><b>Global</b></a><br>
				Each script can define 10 global variables (<span class="code">globalaccum</span>) 
				which can be used by any routine within the script. For example, the Battery 
				script keeps track of the door generators by use of a global variable. Several 
				routines in the script reference the state of this variable (<span class="code">globalaccum</span>
				) to determine what state the generator is in. Built or destroyed.
